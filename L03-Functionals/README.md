Lecture 3: Functionals

These example files are snapshots of progressive states of the coding demo planned for the lecture.
Each demo has a `.js` file and a `.html` file.  The HTML files are almost exactly the same across demos.
The order of the demos is:

    parallel (copied from last lecture)
    oops
    parallelF
    map
    mapMethod
    parallelF2
    parallelF3
    parallelF4
    parallelF5

Some helper functions are found in `l03.js`.  The code there isn't written to be comprehensible yet at this point in the course, but it may still be interesting.

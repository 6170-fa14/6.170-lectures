Lecture 2: Functional Programming and Callbacks

These example files are snapshots of progressive states of the coding demo planned for the lecture.
Each demo has a `.js` file and a `.html` file.  The HTML files are almost exactly the same across demos.
The order of the demos is:

    writer
    delayed
    fetch
    fetchAsync
    parallel
    serial
    mutating

Some helper functions are found in `l02.js`.  The code there isn't written to be comprehensible yet at this point in the course, but it may still be interesting.

Files `fastserver.js` and `slowserver.js` are used to support examples like `fetch`.
They use Node.js, which we haven't introduced properly yet; but it shouldn't be too important to understand their inner workings yet.

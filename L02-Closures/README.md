Lecture 1: Intro

These example files are snapshots of progressive states of the coding demo planned for the lecture.
Each demo has a .js file and a .html file.  The HTML files are almost exactly the same across demos.
The order of the demos is:

    writer
    delayed
    parallel
    serial
    fetch

Files fastserver.js and slowserver.js are used to support examples like 'fetch'.
They use Node.js, which we haven't introduced properly yet; but it shouldn't be too important to understand their inner workings yet.

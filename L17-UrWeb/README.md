Lecture 17: Ur/Web

Ur/Web is a new Web programming language, developed in Prof. Chlipala's group.  It's certainly not part of the core material of 6.170; this is a kind of "bonus" lecture, involving a look at one contender for the future of programming the Web and similar platforms!  More information, including the language implementation itself, can be found on the project home page:
